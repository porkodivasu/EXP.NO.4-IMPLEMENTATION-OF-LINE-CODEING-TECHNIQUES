# EXP.NO.4-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-LINE-CODEING-TECHNIQUES

3.Implementation of Line Codeing Techniques 
  
AIM
The objective of this experiment is to study the Line coding techniques using the trainer kit.

APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)

PROCEDURE
Connect the trainer kit to the power supply and switch it ON.

Set the clock frequency and apply the data input signal.

Choose a specific line coding technique (e.g., NRZ-L, NRZ-M, BIO-M, etc.) using the selector switch on the trainer kit.

Use patch cords to connect the output to the DSO.

Observe and record the output waveform.

Repeat the steps for all line coding techniques.

Note down the ON and OFF durations for logical ONE and ZERO from the DSO display.
